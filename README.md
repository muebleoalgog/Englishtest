# PTE Practice Coach

A lightweight Windows-friendly desktop app built with Tkinter to help you practice for the Pearson Test of English (PTE). It offers quick practice activities for speaking, writing, listening, and reading without any external dependencies.

## Features
- **Speaking:** Note-taking space and guidance for recording your own responses to describe-image or repeat-lecture style tasks.
- **Writing:** Rotating prompts for summarize-written-text and essay tasks, with instant word-count feedback, keyword coverage, and cohesion hints.
- **Listening:** Short lecture transcripts with summary prompts and keyword coverage checks to ensure your notes capture key points.
- **Reading:** Multiple-choice single-answer questions with explanations so you can review why the correct option works.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+ with Tkinter available (included with standard Windows Python installers).

## Running the app
From the project folder, launch the GUI:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Tips for use
- Speak for the full timer when recording yourself; prioritize clarity and natural pacing.
- Plan 1-2 minutes before writing so your structure is clear.
- For summaries, aim for 30-50 words and include the main nouns and verbs from the source.
- In reading tasks, skim the question before scanning the passage for evidence.
